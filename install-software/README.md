# Workstation Setup Scripts

These scripts work with Ubuntu linux and Macos

## Automated workflow

- `./part1.sh`
- reboot
- `./part2.sh`
- reboot 
- You should be good to go!

## Manual workflow

Run one of the scripts if you only want one part. Example run `java.sh` if you only want to install java.

## Post workflow run

Check out either .bashrc or .zshrc (whatever one you use), scroll to the bottom, make sure all is well with the world.
Clean things up as you like, uncomment lines, etc...

## Notes

`part1.sh` and `part2.sh` will run different sections of the automated setup. 
It is intended to reboot (or logout and back in) between the two parts.

`reboot.sh` and `append_config.sh` are helper scripts.

All other scripts are different parts of the workflow.
